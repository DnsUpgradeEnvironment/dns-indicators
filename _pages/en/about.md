### The UN Sustainable Development Goals

The "Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development" is a global United Nations action plan for people, the planet and prosperity, which has been adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. The Agenda 2030 of the United Nations is a roadmap to "transform the world for the better" by the year 2030 in terms of sustainable transformation of society, economy and environment. The Agenda 2030 contains 17 global goals divided into 169 targets.

### Reviewing the goal achievement

The UN Statistical Commission was charged together with the national statistical offices to develop global indicators for the targets. The mandated â€žInter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators" (IAEG-SDGs) presented and continuously developed a set of indicators for this purpose. This IAEG-SDGs consists of statistical offices of some UN member states, including the Federal Statistical Office for Germany.

### Data on the global indicators for Germany

Although the indicators were mainly developed for measuring the international and not a national goal achievement, many global indicators can also be calculated nationally. This website presents a compilation of indicators available for Germany based both on official statistics as well as on other sources. To a large extent data for global indicators is available on national level. However, for some of the globally agreed indicators national time-series are unavailable. One reason for this is that certain internationally relevant indicators cannot be meaningfully calculated for Germany. Some other indicators cannot be statistically measured but only answered politically. Another reason is missing national statistical information required to calculate such indicators. In some cases, national data is available with slightly different definitions compared to the ones internationally used.

Destatis is responsible for the development and collection of German data for the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG) global indicators and for reporting Germany's progress towards them.

This website is for disseminating German SDG indicator data. We are at an Alpha stage in development, so the site is still 'work in progress'.
