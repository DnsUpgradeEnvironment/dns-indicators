## National reporting platform - SDG

National reporting platform - SDG is a publicly available tool serving dissemination and presentation of indicators monitoring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda (with data for Germany) and a set of indicators for monitoring sustainable development on the level of the country.
### Our aproach to NRP

In order to conform with the UN's Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the minimum characteristics an SDG NRP should have are that it should:
- be managed by national statistical offices;
- features official statistics and metadata according to established standard methodology;
- be publicly accessible;
- allows for feedback from data users;
- features open source (free) technology.

In addition, the German NRP reporting platform has been developed in accordance with recognized international guidelines, especially with regard to open data and software.

## NRP - sources

The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national reporting platforms, in particular as an open source solution for the presentation of SDG indicators. Precursors in this field are the USA and Great Britain.
The current version of the German reporting platform has been developed based on an earlier version of the UK NRP, and adapted to the needs of German statistics.
The project code is publicly available in a [Github repository](https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-indicators).

The new universal version of the open-sdg platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available.
We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the national US and UK platforms for SDG and the project documentation.
