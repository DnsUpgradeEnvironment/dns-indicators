ODA mainly includes expenditure for financial and technical cooperation with developing and emerging countries, humanitarian aid as well as contributions for development assistance to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union (EU), the World Bank or regional development banks. Furthermore, expenditure for specific peace missions, debt cancellation as well as costs of specific development assistance provided in the donor country, such as the tuition costs of university students from developing and emerging countries or expenditure for development-related research, can also be counted as ODA. In 2015, the calculation basis of the German ODA was adjusted to take greater account of the costs of housing, care and education of refugees within the donor country.<br><br><br><br>An expert group of the DAC has submitted proposals for harmonising and improving the comparability of the methods used to determine ODA eligible expenditure for refugees within the country. These proposals can be implemented by Member States as of reference year 2017 and have to be implemented as of reference year 2019 at the latest. The OECD, or the DAC, also define the list of ODA eligible developing and emerging countries. This includes the least developed countries (LDCs) on the one hand and other countries with low and medium GNI per capita on the other. Members of the G7 and Russia, the EU as well as EU accession candidates with a fixed accession date are excluded. The list is updated every three years. Changes in the indicator can also result from the fact that individual or several countries are added to or removed from the list.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, official development expenditure as a percentage of German GNI was 0.66&nbsp;% according to provisional figures. Net ODA flows in 2017 were around 21.9 billion euros (provisional value), which was a decrease of 2.1&nbsp;% year on year (22.4 billion euros). It should be noted that Germany saw a large influx of immigrants from conflict regions in 2015 and 2016. Benefits for the provision of basic services in Germany to asylum seekers from developing countries can be reported as ODA. This is one of the main reasons for the sharp increase of the figures recorded for 2015 and 2016 compared to 2014. In 2017, a slight reduction can be observed with decreasing immigration. Excluding the costs of refugees, the ODA quota remained almost constant from 2016 to 2017.<br><br><br><br>In an international comparison, Germany was the second largest donor of ODA funds in absolute terms in 2017 (provisional results) after the USA and ahead of the UK. With reference to GNI, the rate of 0.66&nbsp;% achieved by Germany in 2017 is above the average value of the EU members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (0.59&nbsp;%). In relative terms, Germany ranks 6th out of the 29 DAC member countries. The international goal of 0.7&nbsp;% was achieved in 2017 by Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and the UK.<br><br><br><br>In addition to official development assistance, private organisations such as churches, foundations and associations also make contributions. This private development assistance, which does not qualify as ODA, amounted to 1.3 billion euros in 2017, equating to a share of 0.04&nbsp;% of gross national income. Private direct investment in developing and emerging countries totalled 10.9 billion euros in 2017 (before revision).", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_1"=>"https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Staat/Oeffentliche-Finanzen/Entwicklungszusammenarbeit/_inhalt.html", "source_url_text_1"=>"", "source_active_2"=>true, "source_organisation_2"=>"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)", "source_organisation_2_short"=>"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development", "source_organisation_logo_2"=>"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\" Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_2"=>"http://www.bmz.de/de/ministerium/zahlen_fakten/oda/index.html", "source_url_text_2"=>"", "source_active_3"=>true, "source_organisation_3"=>"Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung", "source_organisation_3_short"=>"Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD)", "source_organisation_logo_3"=>"<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logos/oecd.png\" alt=\" Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD)\" title=\"Klicken Sie hier um zu der Homepage der Organisation zu gelangen\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_3"=>"https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/idsonline.htm", "source_url_text_3"=>"", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"17.1 Expenditure for official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income", "history_target_1"=>"Increase the proportion to 0.7&nbsp;% of GNI by 2030", "history_year_a_1"=>"2017", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_b_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_c_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_d_1"=>"2014", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_e_1"=>"2013", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_f_1"=>"2012", "history_status_year_f_1"=>"Blitz", "history_year_g_1"=>"2011", "history_status_year_g_1"=>"Wolke", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Calculation in grant equivalents"}], "data_footnote"=>"2019 provisional data", "computation_units"=>"Percentage share of total imports to Germany", "copyright"=>"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021", "graph_title"=>"Expenditure for official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income", "graph_type"=>"bar", "graph_min_value"=>"", "graph_max_value"=>"", "stackedBar"=>"", "national_geographical_coverage"=>"Germany", "page_content"=>"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2017 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>", "national_metadata_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_metadata_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/45961d32dd5a85c0698dffe02deaa3afb11c2b13", "national_data_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_data_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4", "postulate"=>"Supporting sustainable development"}], "size"=>1}

In this case, the type of the imported goods is also recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, their value and weight. The service sector is excluded from foreign trade statistics.<br><br><br><br>The various countries are classified as LDCs based on the list of recipients of official development assistance kept by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The classifications valid in the respective year according to the OECD-DAC are used for this indicator. If the status of a country changes, this will impact the indicator even if the value of imports from this country remains unchanged. However, changes in the status of countries are scarcely relevant to the development of the indicator in the period shown.<br><br><br><br>Various factors can influence the value and development of the indicator. These can include technology transfers or changes in customs duties, but also the political stability of a country or the infrastructure. The additional provision of figures for processed products should address, at least to some extent, the question as to whether Germany mainly uses the LDCs as sources of basic materials for industrial products or whether the LDCs themselves are able to gain benefits from the value added by participating in the production process.<br><br><br><br>Due to reimports, duplicate counting in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be excluded. The fact that the imports from LDCs are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. This means that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from LDCs, but also on the value of all imports.<br><br><br><br>In addition to Germany’s overall imports from LDCs, the graph also shows the share of processed products. This includes all goods that are not classified as “raw materials” in the classification by product group of the food and industrial economy (EGW). Accordingly, unprocessed or barely processed goods extracted from nature, such as crude oil, ores, logs or plant-based textile fibres, are not included. In contrast, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br><br><br>Imports from LDCs as a proportion of all imports to Germany was 0.93&nbsp;% or 9.6 billion euros in 2017 (provisional results). This is an increase of more than 113&nbsp;% compared with 2002, when the share was just 0.44&nbsp;%. However, the positive development has been observed only since 2008. The share of imports of processed products from LDCs increased even more sharply between 2002 and 2017 (+146&nbsp;%). It has now reached 0.88% of total imports to Germany (2002: 0.36&nbsp;%), which equates to a value of around 9.1 billion euros. If the increase of the last five years continues, it can be assumed that the target will be reached.<br><br><br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that almost three quarters of imports from LDCs in 2017 came from Bangladesh (55.51&nbsp;%) and Cambodia (16.04&nbsp;%). Considering not only the LDCs but all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2017 was 21.86&nbsp;%, and the share of processed products was 20.09&nbsp;% (from 13.67&nbsp;% and 12.17&nbsp;% in 2002, respectively). Consequently, the imports from LDCs both in terms of all goods as well as processed goods accounted for a rather small share of imports from developing and emerging countries.
