Nor should the term be confused with school drop-outs. On the contrary, it refers to people between 18 and 24 years of age who neither have obtained a higher education entrance qualification such as “Abitur” or “Fachhochschulreife” (for universities in general or universities of applied sciences), nor have completed vocational training and who are not attending initial and continuing education/ training programmes. This means that even those young people who, for example, have successfully completed “Hauptschule” or “Realschule” (lower secondary education, ISCED level 2) but are no longer participating in the education process are also counted as early school leavers. Moreover, it is not possible to conclude what type of educational institution they last attended and at what time.<br><br><br><br>The information originates from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1&nbsp;% of the population. The annual school statistics, which is a coordinated Länder statistics, provides supplementary information also published by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, according to provisional results, the indicator value was [10.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-1-a/)&nbsp;%, i.e. there were a total of 614,000 young people without completed upper secondary education who were not or no longer undergoing (vocational) training or continuing education. The 2020 target has not yet been achieved.<br><br><br><br>Between 1999 and 2005, the gender-specific indicator values deviated from the total values to varying degrees and in different directions. Since 2006, there have been fewer women than men leaving school early without a certificate of completion. For instance, the figures were 9.0&nbsp;% for women and 11.1&nbsp;% for men in 2017.<br><br><br><br>According to school statistics, a total of around 52,685 young people (6.6&nbsp;% of the resident population of the same age) left school without a “Hauptschule” certificate in 2016. Compared with 1999, this is a decline of somewhat more than a third.

Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can also improve the compatibility of work and family life, and other types of care, e.g. day care in private homes, are not included. Furthermore, information on childcare services aimed at children aged 6 years and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is included, for example, in the data of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last paragraph).<br><br><br><br>In 2018, all-day care in day care centres was arranged for 45.9&nbsp;% of the 3 to 5-year-old children (kindergarten age). For children under 3 years of age (nursery age) this figure was 16.5&nbsp;%. As a result, children in all-day care as a proportion of all 3 to 5-year-olds has increased by just under 24 percentage points since 2006 and has therefore more than doubled. The full-day care of children below the age of 3 rose by 10.6 percentage points from 2006 to 2018 and has thus almost tripled. Overall, both indicators are developing in the intended direction, with indicator 4.2.b being closer to the target value than indicator 4.2.a.<br><br><br><br>The total number of children under six years of age receiving all-day care in day care centres in 2018 was 1.4 million; the number of children in part-time care was 1.3 million. Another 61,000 children under six years of age were cared for in private homes by publicly supported childminders. In addition to that, some of the 5-year-olds go to school already.<br><br><br><br>More than a quarter of the children cared for in day care centres or by publicly supported childminding services had a migrant background, meaning that at least one of the parents was of foreign origin. 50&nbsp;% of these children were in day care in 2018, compared with 69&nbsp;% of the children without a migrant background.<br><br><br><br> With regard to the availability of all-day care provided by facilities, there is a clear gap between the Länder in the east and the Länder in the west of Germany. The highest percentages of 0 to 2-year-olds in all-day care are recorded in the eastern Länder and in Berlin. The values range from 49.2&nbsp;% in Thuringia to 9.7&nbsp;% in Baden-Württemberg. For 3 to 5-year-olds, the percentage was also highest in Thuringia at 91.8&nbsp;% and lowest in Baden-Württemberg at 24.5&nbsp;% (each 2018).<br><br><br><br>When it comes to opportunities of care for pupils, pre and after-school care programmes and all-day schools also play a significant role. In 2018, 19,000 children between 5 and 13 years of age were looked after on an all-day basis in care programmes and 483,200 children part-time (lessons are not regarded as childcare). The percentage of pupils attending all-day schools of all pupils in schools of general education was 42.5&nbsp;% in the 2016/2017 school year. However, this figure includes pupils from all school types and hence includes also pupils who are older than 13 years. In primary schools, 40.1&nbsp;% of children received all-day care in that school year.
