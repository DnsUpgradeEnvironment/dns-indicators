This involves about 14,000 private households in Germany which voluntarily provide information on their income and living conditions annually.<br><br><br><br>The indicators show the respective proportion of the population for which according to a self-assessment involuntary foregoing or deficiencies in several areas apply for financial reasons. The selected survey variables are expenditures based on a lifestyle that is considered appropriate, desirable or even necessary in Europe. These nine criteria used to characterise “material deprivation” are standardised across all countries in which EU-SILC is conducted, thereby allowing Europe-wide comparisons.<br><br><br><br>Specifically, the nine criteria cover: the lack of a car, a washing machine, a colour TV or a telephone in the household (in each case because the household is unable to afford one); a financial difficulty, paying rent, mortgage or utility bills on time, ensuring adequate heating in the residence, eating meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day, spending one week’s holidays per year outside the actual residence or meeting unplanned expenditures of a specific amount (poverty threshold of the previous year; 2017: 1,000 euros) from one’s own financial resources.<br><br><br><br>Material deprivation is associated with the problem of social exclusion because participation in social life is jeopardised by the lack of financial means. The “severe material deprivation” indicator is also part of the “poverty or social exclusion” indicator, which is used to measure one of the five core objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy (combating poverty and social exclusion).<br><br><br><br>In 2017, 9.1&nbsp;% of the population in Germany were classified as materially deprived, while 3.4&nbsp;% were affected by severe material deprivation. The corresponding values were 11.1&nbsp;% and 4.5&nbsp;% in 2010 and slightly higher in some subsequent years, resulting in a slight decline over time, similar to the EU as a whole. However, the average values for persons in the EU are significantly higher than the respective values for Germany. For instance, the proportion of the materially deprived EU population in 2017 was 14.7&nbsp;% according to the estimates of the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and was therefore more than 50&nbsp;% higher than in Germany. A total of 6.7&nbsp;% of the EU population were considered as severely materially deprived persons. This rate is 97&nbsp;% higher than the respective value in Germany.

The relevant time series for the indicator is based on the moving five-year average of the total balances of the relevant year as well as the two preceding and subsequent years. Thereby, yearly meteorological and market fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by farms, are balanced. The indicator does not provide an interpretation regarding the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses. Even if the average value, defined as a national target for Germany, is not reached, regional nitrogen surpluses can be considerably higher than 70&nbsp;kg per hectare and year.<br><br><br><br>During the period from 1992 to 2014, the nitrogen balance fell from 121 to 97&nbsp;kg per hectare and year (– 19.5&nbsp;%). Following the major reduction in nitrogen surpluses at the beginning of the time series, the nitrogen surplus fell by only 0.9&nbsp;% between 2010 and 2014. If this trend continues, decreasing the nitrogen surplus to 70&nbsp;kg/ha of utilised agricultural area on annual average between 2028 and 2032 may not be possible.<br><br><br><br>The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus in the early 1990s resulted from diminished use of fertilisers and falling numbers of livestock in the new Länder. The marginal decline of the indicator in the remaining course of the time series is based on a minor reduction in mineral fertiliser use and improved harvest yields resulting from technical advances in plant production and breeding (more efficient nitrogen fertilisation, variety spectrum) combined with the simultaneous expansion in the cultivation of high-yield crop types (maize, wheat) as well as improved feed conversion by livestock.<br><br><br><br>The indicator reveals a direct connection to the indicators [3.2.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/3-2-a/) “Emissions of air pollutants”, [6.1.b](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/6-1-b/) “Nitrate in groundwater”, [14.1.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/14-1-a/) “Nitrogen input to the North and the Baltic Sea through German inflows” and [15.2](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/15-2-a/) “Eutrophication of ecosystems”.", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius Kühn Institute", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius Kühn Institute", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.julius-kuehn.de/en/crop-and-soil-science/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/jki.png\" alt=\" Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius Kühn Institute\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_1"=>"https://www.bmel-statistik.de/landwirtschaft/statistischer-monatsbericht-des-bmel-kapitel-a-landwirtschaft/", "source_url_text_1"=>"Nährstoffbilanzen und Düngemittel (Only available in German)", "source_active_2"=>true, "source_organisation_2"=>"Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen", "source_organisation_2_short"=>"Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen", "source_organisation_logo_2"=>"<a href=\"https://www.uni-giessen.de/faculties/f09/institutes/landscape?set_language=en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ug.png\" alt=\" Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_2"=>"https://www.bmel-statistik.de/landwirtschaft/statistischer-monatsbericht-des-bmel-kapitel-a-landwirtschaft/", "source_url_text_2"=>"Nährstoffbilanzen und Düngemittel (Only available in German)", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"2.1.a Nitrogen surplus in agriculture", "history_target_1"=>"On an annual average for the period 2028 to 2032, a reduction of the nitrogen surpluses of the overall balance for Germany to 70 kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area", "history_year_a_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Blitz", "history_year_b_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_c_1"=>"2014", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_d_1"=>"2013", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Blitz", "history_year_e_1"=>"2012", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_f_1"=>"2011", "history_status_year_f_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_g_1"=>"2010", "history_status_year_g_1"=>"Sonne", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Moving five-year average, referring to the middle year"}], "data_footnote"=>"2018 provisional data", "computation_units"=>"Kilograms per hectare", "copyright"=>"&copy;

It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual’s height in metres. This calculation does not take age-specific and gender-specific differences into account. Nor does it indicate the individual body mass composition. However, obesity and excess weight among children and adolescents are defined by taking account also of age and gender. In order to determine if people suffer from obesity or excess weight, the individual BMI value is compared with a defined comparison group (reference population). The percentile reference values according to Kromeyer-Hauschild as recommended by the “Arbeitsgemeinschaft Adipositas im Kinder- und Jugendalter” (AGA) are used as a comparative benchmark. According to these values, children and adolescents are considered to be overweight if their BMI value is above the 90th age- and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> P90). This means that they fall within the range of those 10&nbsp;% of the reference group with the highest BMI values. A BMI value above the 97th percentile of the reference population (that is, as high as the 3&nbsp;% of adolescents with the highest BMI values) is classified as obesity (> P97). These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985 and 1998 in various regions of Germany using different methods.<br><br><br><br>The data for the indicator are gathered by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS – referred to as the KiGGS baseline study) for the period 2003 to 2006 delivered the first nationwide representative results. In 2015, new results for the reporting years 2009 to 2012 were published (KiGGS Wave 1). These results were based on information provided by respondents via telephone rather than on measured data as in the baseline survey. New measurement data are available for the period 2014 to 2017 from the second follow-up survey of the KiGGS study (KiGGS Wave 2). In order to allow the data to be compared in a suitable way, the results were age standardised to the reference date 31 December 2015 of the population update.<br><br><br><br>For the time period 2014 to 2017, 8.0&nbsp;% of the adolescents were classified as obese. The proportion of girls was 7.2&nbsp;% and that of boys 8.7&nbsp;%. In the period 2003–2006, the proportion of adolescents suffering from obesity was [8.3](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-3-a/)&nbsp;%, that is, 8.2&nbsp;% of the girls and [8.4](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-4-a/)&nbsp;% of the boys. Overall, the obesity rate among adolescents was slightly down. While the obesity rate amongst girls decreased by 1.0 percentage point, the rate increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points amongst boys.<br><br><br><br>The proportion of adolescents suffering from excess weight including obesity (> P90) did not change much compared with the period 2003 – 2006 (increase by 0.6 percentage points to 18.7&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>Important factors in the development of overweight are dietary and exercise behaviour, which differ – when looking at the results – in terms of socioeconomic status (SES). The results from KiGGS Wave 2 confirm that 3 to 17-year-old children and adolescents with a low socioeconomic status eat unhealthy more often than their peers from socially better-off families and exercise less frequently. The risk of overweight and obesity is about 3 to 4 times higher for children and adolescents with low SES than in the upper status group (about 20&nbsp;% of the study population).<br><br><br><br>An opposite phenomenon to overweight is underweight. A BMI value below the 10th percentile of the reference population indicates underweight. The proportion of underweight adolescents has developed in a negative direction over the last few years, increasing from 7.4&nbsp;% to [8.4](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-4-a/)&nbsp;%. In this context, an increase from 7.1&nbsp;% to 7.5&nbsp;% can be seen among girls, while the proportion of boys increased even more strongly from 7.7&nbsp;% to 9.2&nbsp;%.

The BMI is a benchmark that does not take account of the physique, age- and gender-specific differences as well as the individual body mass composition. <br><br><br><br>The data used for the indicator are based on the microcensus of the Federal Statistical Office. The sample survey is conducted among 1&nbsp;% of the total population. The responses to the health questions, which are generally asked every four years, are voluntary. Consequently, the indicator is based on the proportion of the population with a BMI of 30 and higher that also answered the microcensus questions concerning body weight and body size. The corresponding data were standardised relative to the European population of 1990 to allow data from different years and regions to be compared without distortions due to different age structures. Since the questions on health in the microcensus are not asked annually, the interim years in the chart were interpolated.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, 14.6&nbsp;% of the population in Germany over the age of 18 were obese.

At that time, the proportion of women ([10.2](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-2-a/)&nbsp;%) affected by obesity was also slightly lower than that of men (11.1&nbsp;%). Thus, the obesity rate among adults has increased and is developing contrary to the goal envisioned by the German Sustainable Development Strategy. Another 33.9&nbsp;% of the population aged 18 and over had a BMI of 25 to under 30 in 2017. In total, 48.5&nbsp;% were considered to be overweight (BMI 25 and over).

It is interesting to note that the proportion of obese women is higher than the proportion of obese men at older ages – above about 75 years of age. At this age, however, the proportion of men in the population is also considerably lower. As of 31 December 2017, the proportion of men aged 75 and over in the population at this age was only 40&nbsp;%, while the gender distribution between 50 and 60 years was balanced.

This recorded data which is called background pollution is combined with geographical information to determine the number of persons who are exposed to an average annual particulate matter pollution of more than 20 μg per m³ of air at their place of residence.

This means that even those young people who, for example, have successfully completed “Hauptschule” or “Realschule” (lower secondary education, ISCED level 2) but are no longer participating in the education process are also counted as early school leavers.

Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can also improve the compatibility of work and family life, and other types of care, e.g. day care in private homes, are not included. Furthermore, information on childcare services aimed at children aged 6 years and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is included, for example, in the data of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last paragraph).<br><br><br><br>In 2018, all-day care in day care centres was arranged for 45.9&nbsp;% of the 3 to 5-year-old children (kindergarten age).

As a result, children in all-day care as a proportion of all 3 to 5-year-olds has increased by just under 24 percentage points since 2006 and has therefore more than doubled. The full-day care of children below the age of 3 rose by 10.6 percentage points from 2006 to 2018 and has thus almost tripled.

Another 61,000 children under six years of age were cared for in private homes by publicly supported childminders. In addition to that, some of the 5-year-olds go to school already.<br><br><br><br>More than a quarter of the children cared for in day care centres or by publicly supported childminding services had a migrant background, meaning that at least one of the parents was of foreign origin. 50&nbsp;% of these children were in day care in 2018, compared with 69&nbsp;% of the children without a migrant background.<br><br><br><br> With regard to the availability of all-day care provided by facilities, there is a clear gap between the Länder in the east and the Länder in the west of Germany.

In 2018, 19,000 children between 5 and 13 years of age were looked after on an all-day basis in care programmes and 483,200 children part-time (lessons are not regarded as childcare).

Therefore, it only expresses the relative average gross hourly earnings as a ratio without considering the underlying causes, such as qualification, occupation or a different employment history.<br><br><br><br>The data for the indicator are based on the four-yearly structure of earnings survey conducted by the statistical offices of the Länder as a representative sample survey covering a maximum of 60,000 businesses who are obliged to provide the requested information. Based on these data, results are provided by age, educational attainment, performance group, activity, collective agreement, company size class and economic sector, and the adjusted gender pay gap (GPG) is published. For the interim years, the unadjusted GPG is updated using the rates of change from the quarterly survey of earnings. In the following, the EU definition is used for the adjusted and unadjusted GPG; it excludes employees in “agriculture, forestry and fishing”, “public administration and defence; compulsory social security” and in micro-enterprises.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the unadjusted gender pay gap was 21&nbsp;% on average. This means that the average gross hourly earnings of women were by around one fifth lower than those earnings of men. Since 1995 the unadjusted GPG has scarcely changed. Hence, if the trend recorded over the last five years continues, the goal set for 2020 will not be achieved.<br><br><br><br>On an EU average, the unadjusted GPG was 16&nbsp;% in 2016. The countries with the smallest differences in unadjusted gross hourly earnings, along with Italy and Romania (5&nbsp;%), were Belgium and Luxembourg (6&nbsp;%). Only in Estonia (25&nbsp;%) and the Czech Republic (22&nbsp;%) was the unadjusted GPG higher in 2016 than in Germany (21&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>However, there was no uniform picture for Germany. The unadjusted gender pay gap varied markedly between the Länder: in 2017, the GPG was highest in Baden-Württemberg with 27&nbsp;%, whereas in Saxony-Anhalt with its overall lower earnings level it was only 2&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>The factors underlying the GPG can be studied every four years based on the detailed results of the structure of earnings survey. The results for 2014 are currently available. These factors, which determine the differences in earnings, are subject to long-term change processes and therefore relatively stable over time. The main quantifiable reasons underlying the unadjusted GPG are women and men working in different sectors and occupations and the unequal division of job requirements in terms of leadership and qualification.

For measures at individual level, the number of girls and women who received (further) vocational training or participated in targeted guidance programmes can be recorded directly. When it comes to the funding of institutions or funding at policy area level, the number of women and girls in the funded (further) training facilities has to be estimated.

The monitoring points used for this purpose are combined in the “EEA monitoring network”. The data are summarised by the German Environment Agency based on information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the Länder and the Federal Government represented by the Federal Environment Ministry (LAWA).<br><br><br><br>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate, a natural nitrogen compound, is caused primarily by the washout of nitrate from various fertilisers that are rich in nitrogen. In addition to farm fertilisers such as liquid manure or slurry that are produced in regions of intensive livestock farming, this also includes the mineral fertilisers used for intensive agriculture. The last few years have also seen an increase in the volume of digestate, which is produced as a by-product of biogas power plants and is likewise used as a fertiliser in agriculture. This also leads to an increased nitrogen content in the soil and therefore to higher nitrate values in groundwater.<br><br><br><br>The natural level of pollution for nitrate is between zero and a maximum of 10&nbsp;mg/l. Contents between 10 and 25&nbsp;mg/l are signs of minor to medium pollution. Concentrations of between 25 and 50&nbsp;mg/l indicate a high level of groundwater pollution. If the threshold value of the Ground Water Ordinance of 50&nbsp;mg/l, on which this indicator is based, is exceeded, the groundwater is in a poor chemical state and without treatment cannot be utilised as drinking water.<br><br><br><br>Similar to the indicator on phosphate in flowing waters, this indicator gives no indication of the extent to which the measured values are higher or lower than the threshold value. It solely captures the number of monitoring points at which the measured values were lower than the specified threshold value. In this context, the number and the representative nature of the distribution of the monitoring points or their regional concentration have a considerable influence on the result of this indicator. In 2015, however, EEA groundwater monitoring was fundamentally revised, adapted and expanded in order to make the results more representative.<br><br><br><br>At some monitoring points the nitrate pollution may have declined sharply. But if it remains above the threshold value of 50&nbsp;mg/l, the decrease is not reflected by the indicator. The same applies to increasing nitrate pollution which, however, remains below the threshold value. The interpretation must also take account of the fact that measures to reduce nitrate pollution may only show an effect with a delay, for example because the percolation time from the surface to the groundwater takes several years.<br><br><br><br>In 2015, the threshold value of 50&nbsp;mg/l of nitrate was exceeded at 19.0&nbsp;% of groundwater monitoring points in the EEA monitoring network. This means that the groundwater there must not be used for drinking water supplies without treatment.

In this case, it is based exclusively on the planned scope of new financing commitments for projects regarding drinking water and sanitation at the time of submission of the programme proposal to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. On this basis, the KfW estimates the number of people who will in future (i.e. after the implementation of these planned projects) receive new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. The funding announced by the KfW includes subsidies and loans, refinanced from the Federal Budget, and internal market funds. The recipients are generally developing and emerging countries, which means that this indicator is related to indicator [17.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/17-1-a/).<br><br><br><br>Due to the data structure, there is a slight overestimation (in the low single-digit percentage range) of the number of people who will have received new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. Thus, according to the classification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), waste disposal and recycling projects are also counted as drinking water and sanitation projects.<br><br><br><br>Concrete estimates of the extent to which the planned figures are achieved, that is, whether the goal has been exceeded or the number of people reached is less than envisaged, can be made only after the relevant infrastructures have been put into operation.<br><br><br><br>Follow-up projects are evaluated as independent projects. However, if the target group of the follow-up project is identical to that of the original project, it is taken into account only once to avoid duplicate counting. Only in duly substantiated exceptional cases is it permitted to count the target group twice, for example, in scenarios where installations previously funded by the KfW are being repaired following violent confrontations or the destruction of infrastructure.<br><br><br><br>Besides the KfW, there are additional stakeholders in Germany (e.g. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, the Länder, private stakeholders), who support access to drinking water and sanitation in developing and emerging countries. The indicator therefore records only a part of the German development cooperation in the drinking water and sanitation sector. Over the past five years, the KfW’s share of total German development cooperation in the water sector has fallen steadily. In 2012 the share was 96.0&nbsp;%, while in 2016 it fell to 78.0&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>In previous years, the planned numbers of people who were to receive access to drinking water and sanitation with German support were always just above the set goal of ten million people. Exceptions are the years 2014 and 2017. In 2014 this was due to a nationwide programme in Mexico which, according to KfW estimates, reached considerably more people than expected. The increase in 2017 can be explained by an almost threefold increase in new financing commitments compared with 2016.

Instead, the actually generated electricity quantities (of wind power and hydropower) are taken into account for this report (energy concept of the Federal Government).<br><br><br><br>Concerning the methodology for calculating the indicator, it should be noted that imports and exports of electricity are not fully included in the final energy consumption of renewable energy sources, whereas they are included in the gross final energy consumption. In this respect, the indicator can over- or underestimate the share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption depending on the foreign trade balance.

Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the amount of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the domestic electricity generation, the balance of exchanges across national borders, the self-consumption of power plants as well as transmission losses. The following are considered to be renewable energy sources: wind energy, hydropower, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and gas from purification plants as well as the bio-degradable proportion of waste from households and the industry.<br><br><br><br>During the period from 1990 to 2017, the share of renewable energy in electricity consumption increased from 3.4&nbsp;% to 36.0&nbsp;%. The goal of achieving 35&nbsp;% by 2020 thus was already reached in 2017. This trend has been driven by legal measures, such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). The EEG requires, among other things, network operators to give priority feed-in to renewable energy.<br><br><br><br>Similarly to indicator [7.2.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/7-2-a/), it should be noted with regard to the methodology used to calculate the indicator that foreign trade of electricity has a direct influence on the denominator of the indicator, but not on the numerator. 1 Regardless of electricity generation from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. For 15 years, Germany has been a growing net exporter of electricity (in 2016: 8.5&nbsp;% of the gross electricity consumption). As a result, the indicator overestimates the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption over the same time period.<br><br><br><br>Since 2000, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation has risen, in particular due to the increased use of wind energy, biomass and photovoltaics. In the period between 2000 and 2017, a slight downward trend in the generation of electricity from conventional fuels coincided with an increase of more than 180 TWh in the production of renewable electricity.

It includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), machinery and equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools), weapons systems and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources). Also included are improvements on existing stocks of fixed assets that lead to a significant increase in the value of an asset and/or prolong its useful life.<br><br><br><br>Gross fixed capital formation is determined as part of national accounts, which are compiled in accordance with harmonised European rules and based on all available, relevant data sources.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP was 20.3&nbsp;% and was thus 4.5 percentage points below the initial value in 1991 for the entire federal territory as well as 2.7&nbsp;% percentage points lower than in 2000. The indicator has moved into the desired direction both in the short and medium term; however, it has been largely stagnating since 2002. The share would be almost unchanged (19.5&nbsp;%) on a price-adjusted basis compared with 2010. The investment ratio in Germany was an annual average of 19.9&nbsp;% between 2007 and 2016, which was below the investment ratio for the entire OECD region (20.9&nbsp;%). The difference has been considerably smaller since 2010 than in the period between 2003 and 2008 (– 2.9 percentage points).<br><br><br><br>Looking at the time series reveals a wavelike trend in the investment ratio that is marked by declines at the start of the millennium and, following a slight recovery, again in 2009 after the financial market and economic crisis of 2008/2009. Up to 2011, investment activity recovered, and gross fixed capital formation once again exceeded the level of the pre-crisis year. Between 2014 and 2017, gross fixed capital formation grew strongly by 13.3&nbsp;% in total and reached a level of 666 billion euros.

Gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment at current prices increased most recently by 2.6&nbsp;% (2016) and 4.2&nbsp;% (2017) compared to the previous year and – despite the sharp decline in 2009 (– 22.0&nbsp;%) – surpassed the pre-crisis level of 2008. The strongest growth since 1991 was recorded for gross fixed capital formation in research and development as well as in computer software and databases. Between 1991 and 2017 its volume almost tripled.<br><br><br><br>The period from 1991 to 2017 witnessed a strong shift in investment activity from industry to the service sector. In 1991, 30.9&nbsp;% of new fixed capital formation was still being made by enterprises of the industry sector. By 2017, this figure had fallen to just 23.7&nbsp;%.

The focus in this context is primarily on goods and services that are traded on markets as well as on public goods and services. GDP is determined quarterly and annually by the Federal Statistical Office in accordance with rules that are harmonised throughout Europe. Due to the early calculation dates, many of the necessary basic data are not available in time for the first release date. Instead, the first release is still largely based on indicators and estimates. Missing information is initially estimated or carried forward.

However, GDP is not suitable for use as a welfare indicator, because an assessment of material wealth is not sufficient to achieve a comprehensive calculation of well-being and quality of life. This requires additional indicators, for example, to cover unpaid work in households, which is not included in the calculation of GDP.

It has a value between 0 and 1. The value 0 means that every person has exactly the same income whereas the value 1 indicates that only one person receives all the income, thereby representing a situation of maximum income inequality. However, the Gini coefficient of income distribution does not take into account which sources are used to generate income (e.g. wages, income from rent or income from capital).<br><br><br><br>The equivalised income is a value derived from the total income of a household and the number and age of the people living from this income. With the help of an equivalence scale, the incomes are weighted according to household size and composition, as the shared use of living space and household appliances results in efficiency gains. This approach makes it possible to compare incomes irrespective of the household size or the age of the household members because the equivalised income is allocated equally to each household member. The equivalised disposable income is a household’s income including social transfers, after taxes and other deductions, and is therefore the income available for expenditures and savings. A distinction must be made between this measure and the equivalised income before social transfers on the one hand, which looks at the disposable income without possible social transfers (e.g. unemployment benefits, housing assistance), and market income on the other, which is calculated before taxes, social contributions and social benefits.<br><br><br><br>The initial data for equivalised income are taken from the Europe-wide harmonised annual statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC), the data on income distribution come from the “Household Finance and Consumption Survey” (HFCS) conducted at irregular intervals by the European Central Bank. The fact that households with high income and extensive assets are under-represented in voluntary sample surveys is methodologically compensated for. Therefore, the values for income as well as for assets in Germany are comparable to those of Europe and the Eurozone in terms of methodology. Beyond this, no equivalent, methodologically harmonised and verifiable internationally comparative values are available. Since EU-SILC is not yet drawn upon to calculate a Gini coefficient for market income, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) of the German Institute for Economic Research are used for this purpose.<br><br><br><br>As in previous years, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income for Germany (0.295) almost equals that for the European Union (0.308) and shows a stable pattern over the years. Thus, there are no significant differences in income distribution between Germany and Europe. Furthermore, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income is well below the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income before social benefits without pensions (0.295 as compared with 0.359). As expected, the Gini coefficient of market income was even higher at 0.504 (2015). In Germany, social benefits, social insurance and taxes thus contribute considerably to reducing inequalities in disposable income.<br><br><br><br>Turning to the corresponding Gini coefficient (2014: 0.76), wealth in Germany is much less evenly distributed than income. In this context, hardly any change can be detected over time (2010: 0.76). The gap to the respective European value (Eurozone 2010: 0.69) is substantial. However, the impression of there being a disproportionately high wealth inequality is qualified by several factors not covered by the Gini coefficient. For instance, the evaluation of wealth does not take into account future pension entitlements. In addition, due to the stricter protection of tenants’ rights, people in Germany are more likely to rent than own their homes, compared to other European countries.", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_active_2"=>true, "source_organisation_2"=>"Eurostat", "source_organisation_2_short"=>"Eurostat", "source_organisation_logo_2"=>"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/eurostat.png\" alt=\" Eurostat\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_2"=>"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di12c&lang=de", "source_url_text_2"=>"", "source_active_3"=>true, "source_organisation_3"=>"Deutsche Bundesbank", "source_organisation_3_short"=>"German Bundesbank", "source_organisation_logo_3"=>"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bundesbank.png\" alt=\" German Bundesbank\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_3"=>"https://www.bundesbank.de/de/bundesbank/forschung/haushaltsstudie", "source_url_text_3"=>"", "source_active_4"=>true, "source_organisation_4"=>"European Central Bank (ECB)", "source_organisation_4_short"=>"European Central Bank", "source_organisation_logo_4"=>"<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/languagepolicy/html/index.en.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ezb.png\" alt=\" European Central Bank\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_4"=>"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-research/research-networks/html/researcher_hfcn.en.html", "source_url_text_4"=>"", "source_active_5"=>true, "source_organisation_5"=>"German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)", "source_organisation_5_short"=>"German Institute for Economic Research", "source_organisation_logo_5"=>"<a href=\"https://www.diw.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/diw.png\" alt=\" German Institute for Economic Research\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_5"=>"https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.615551.de/forschungsbasierte_infrastruktureinrichtung__sozio-oekonomisches_panel__soep.html", "source_url_text_5"=>"", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"10.2 Gini coefficient of income distribution", "history_target_1"=>"Gini coefficient of income after social transfers to be below the EU-28 average by 2030", "history_year_a_1"=>"2019", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_b_1"=>"2018", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Blitz", "history_year_c_1"=>"2017", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Leicht bewölkt", "history_year_d_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Leicht bewölkt", "history_year_e_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Leicht bewölkt", "history_year_f_1"=>"2014", "history_status_year_f_1"=>"Leicht bewölkt", "history_year_g_1"=>"2013", "history_status_year_g_1"=>"Sonne", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Gini coefficient of equivalised income before social transfers"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income"}, {"field"=>"Area", "value"=>"Germany"}, {"field"=>"Area", "value"=>"EU-28"}], "data_footnote"=>"Gini coefficient of wealth: Interim years were interpolated;

Settlement and transport includes the following types of land use: building and adjacent open area, commercial or industrial area (excluding exploitation area), transport area, recreation area and cemeteries. The indicator does not focus on sealed land, instead it also covers non-built-up and unsealed land such as gardens, yard areas and landscape surrounding transport infrastructure as well as open spaces such as parks and other green spaces, allotment gardens, garden land within towns, sports and leisure facilities, camp sites as well as cemeteries. According to calculations of the environmental-economic accounts of the Länder, the average sealed proportion of the settlement and transport area in the Länder is estimated at just over 45&nbsp;% (2013).<br><br><br><br>The data source for the indicator is the area survey by type of actual use in the official land registers of the Länder. Changes in the methodology of the official land registers in previous years have increasingly resulted in the reclassification of land not caused by real changes of use. In order to partially offset the resulting distortion, a moving average is formed, in each case, from the four preceding years to enable the evaluation of the relevant development.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. For this reason, the development of the indicator in 2016 is shown only as a four-year moving average.<br><br><br><br>Between 1992 and 2015, 8,761 km² of land were converted for use as settlement and transport area. As a result, the settlement and transport area expanded by 21.7&nbsp;% compared to 1992; the settlement area by 29.7&nbsp;% and transport area by [10.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-1-a/)&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>In recent years, this increase in the amount of settlement and transport area has noticeably slowed down. In 2015, the four-year moving average for land used for the first time for settlement and transport purposes was 66 hectares per day, compared to 120 hectares per day at the start of the time series. If the average trend of the previous five years is maintained, the originally specified goal of 30 hectares per day, which is supposed to be reached by 2020, will be achieved in 2030. In 2016, the four-year moving average decreased further to a value of 62 hectares for newly occupied settlement and transport areas. <br><br><br><br>From 2005 to 2009, the development of the settlement area was temporarily dominated by high growth rates in the “recreation area, cemeteries” type of land use. The relevant extent does not reflect any real changes in the landscape and can be attributed, among other things, to the above-mentioned changes in the land register. In 2015, the recreation area and cemeteries accounted for 9.8&nbsp;% of the settlement and transport area, with the increase in cemeteries being only marginal. From 2012 to 2014, the transport area increased considerably again, but declined in 2015.<br><br><br><br>In 2015, the settlement and transport area totalled 49,066 km² and accounted for 13.7&nbsp;% of Germany’s total area.

In the reference period from 1992 to 2015, the wooded area increased by 4,979 km², while the agricultural area decreased by 10,780 km².

Therefore, all areas not covered by the category of housing and transport area are included. A distinction must be made between open space areas, and open areas as well as housing open areas, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks, green spaces or wildlife preserves, which – although they are non-built-up areas – are considered part of the housing and transport area. Therefore, if buildings are erected in gardens, parks or green spaces, this development will not be reflected in this indicator. However, such a development would increase the population density. In this respect, the indicator “Loss of open space area” corresponds to indicators [11.1.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-a/) “Expansion of housing and transport area “ and [11.1.c](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-c/) “Density of settlements”.<br><br><br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. Since population data at regional level are used for the calculation, the 2011 census caused a jump in the time series. Moreover, changes in the methodology of the official land registers in the Länder have increasingly resulted in the reclassification of areas in previous years. To smooth out these effects and to establish the long-term trend, a four-year moving average is calculated, which covers the four preceding years.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. For this reason, the development of the indicator in 2016 is shown only as a four-year moving average.<br><br><br><br>The distinction between “rural” and “non-rural” is based on a type classification of the Thünen Institute. This classification allocates a degree of “ruralness” to rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district – based on spatial characteristics such as “density of settlements”, “share of agricultural and forestry area” and “location relative to the centres”.<br><br><br><br>In the period under review, the loss of per capita open space area declined on average nationwide. Whereas the four-year moving average for 2004 was still around 5 square metres per capita and year, the current average for 2015 is only about 2.9 square metres.<br><br><br><br>Although subject to a similar trend, considerable differences can be observed between rural and non-rural district types in terms of the scope of change. For instance, the loss of open space area per capita and year in rural district types decreased from above 7 to slightly over 4 square metres. In the non-rural district types, it fell from just under 2 to around 1 square metre.

In order to be able to compare the data, the respective values were recalculated on the basis of the 2011 Census and the change in the area survey in 2016.<br><br><br><br>The distinction between “rural” and “non-rural” is based on a type classification of the Thünen Institute. This classification allocates a degree of “ruralness” to rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district – based on spatial characteristics such as “density of settlements”, “share of agricultural and forestry area” and “location relative to the centres”.<br><br><br><br>In contrast to population density, the concept of the density of settlements refers to the ratio of inhabitants solely to the settlement and transport area. In addition to residential building areas, the settlement area includes areas with special functional character (e.g. hospitals and schools), industrial and commercial areas and mixed-use areas as well as open areas (parks, green spaces, garden land). Consequently, changes not only in population numbers, but also in the residential building area, such as an internal densification of the transport or commercial area, lead to a change in the density of settlements.<br><br><br><br>The density of settlements differs substantially between rural and non-rural regions: one square kilometre of settlement and transport area accommodates around 3,330 people on average in non-rural district types, compared with around 1,216 people in rural district types (as in 2016). In this context, the residential building area in cities is frequently a much more densely built-up area as well as has many more multiple-floor buildings than rural regions, where more scattered development incorporating larger, unsealed areas such as domestic gardens is prevalent.<br><br><br><br>From 2000 until the end of 2010, there was a steady decline in the density of settlements in both rural and non-rural regions. In this context, the non-rural regions experienced a slightly lower absolute decrease than the rural regions. Viewed in relative terms, the 11&nbsp;% decline in rural regions, due to their considerably lower density of settlements, was however substantially larger than that of 4&nbsp;% in non-rural regions.<br><br><br><br>Since 2012, differences have been observed between the development in rural and non-rural regions. In non-rural regions, the density of settlements rose steadily from 3,251 inhabitants per square kilometre (2012) to 3,330 (2016). In rural regions, the decrease in the density of settlements continued at a moderate pace until 2014 (1,210 inhabitants/km²). In 2015, however, there was an increase (1,218 inhabitants/km²), presumably due to the population growth resulting from the influx of refugees, which slowed in 2016 (1,216 inhabitants/km²).<br><br><br><br>Considering the development of the number of inhabitants and the settlement and transport area separately, considerable differences between rural and non-rural regions can be observed. Between 2000 and 2015, the volume of the settlement and transport area in both rural and non-rural regions increased, although to different extents of 13&nbsp;% and 8&nbsp;% respectively. Following the slight increase in the population of rural regions at the start of the millennium, it decreased by around 2.3&nbsp;% until 2010 and then increased again slightly by 1&nbsp;% until 2016. In the non-rural regions, however, the population grew between 2000 and 2010 (by about 1.7&nbsp;%) and between 2011 and 2016 (by 4.4&nbsp;%).

TREMOD is a model for evaluating traffic emissions. The data include fuel consumption levels within Germany according to the so-called consumption concept, that is, irrespective of the place of fuelling. “Final energy” refers to the part of the energy used directly during transportation, so this excludes conversion losses that arise during production of fuels as well as possible pipeline losses.<br><br><br><br>The transport performances in goods transport used to calculate the specific energy consumption in this sector are computed by the ifeu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. Road goods transport takes into account transports on lorries with payloads in excess of 3.5 tonnes. However, goods transport by air is not included as it accounts for negligibly small volumes.<br><br><br><br>The indicator for final energy consumption in goods transport refers by definition to consumption within Germany. The influence of the German economy’s increasingly international links in the context of globalisation are reflected only to an insufficient degree. As a result, transport flows and the associated energy consumption that arises due to German exports and imports are not included.<br><br><br><br>In addition to energy consumption, energy efficiency, i.e. energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, is also presented. The number of tonne-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity, or the distance per transported tonne, changes.<br><br><br><br>Contrary to the targeted goal of the Federal Government, final energy consumption for the carriage of goods in 2016 increased by 10.0&nbsp;% compared to 2005. This sharp increase can be attributed primarily to goods transport by road. Final energy consumption for road goods transport increased during this period by 12.2&nbsp;%, while consumption for rail and inland waterways transport was considerably reduced (– 8.5% and – 17.8% respectively).<br><br><br><br>During the same period, the goods transport performance increased by 12.9&nbsp;%. With similar energy consumption in 2005 and 2016, efficiency increased markedly by 2.5&nbsp;% during this period.<br><br><br><br>During the financial and economic crisis of 2009, price-adjusted gross value added in manufacturing suffered a particularly sharp decline of nearly 20&nbsp;%. This heavy loss affected the transport sector in particular, which reacts directly to increases and decreases in the production of goods. The resulting lower utilisation of transport capacity explains the slight increase in average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, despite the fact that overall energy consumption fell sharply during the crisis years.<br><br><br><br>Besides the presumably short-term consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2009, a number of long-term factors also influenced the development of final energy consumption in goods transport during the review period between 2005 and 2016. For instance, the number of production steps per company has decreased, something that is normally associated with greater transport volumes because companies procure more intermediate goods from domestic and international suppliers. Furthermore, the average distance between the production location for the goods and their place of use increased, which also caused transport volumes to increase.

TREMOD is a model for evaluating traffic emissions. The data include fuel consumption levels associated with passenger transport within Germany according to the consumption concept, that is, irrespective of where fuelling takes place. “Final energy” refers to the part of the energy used directly during transportation, so this excludes conversion losses that arise during production of fuels as well as possible pipeline losses.<br><br><br><br>Passenger transport performance specifies the number of passenger-kilometres covered. It is used to calculate the specific energy consumption in this sector and is computed by the ifeu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. For air transport, only domestic flights (national aviation) are taken into account. International flights to and from the federal territory are not included. The carriage of passengers by ship is not included, either.<br><br><br><br>Nearly 30&nbsp;% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity (distance per road/rail or air passenger numbers) changes. In addition to final energy consumption, energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured as energy consumption per passenger-kilometre, is examined.<br><br><br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 1.1&nbsp;% in the period from 2005 to 2016. Analysis of the progress since 2008 reveals that the indicator value increased by 1.7&nbsp;%. Thus final energy consumption in passenger transport is currently developing in a direction which opposes the goal of the German Sustainability Strategy.<br><br><br><br>Although the number of passenger-kilometres covered increased by 10.5&nbsp;% between 2005 and 2016, energy consumption in all forms of transport decreased by 10.5&nbsp;% to 1.43 megajoules per passenger-kilometre during the same period. Consequently, efficiency in passenger transport increased notably. A particularly large share of the efficiency increase can be attributed torail transport. Here, transport performance increased by 24.7&nbsp;%, while final energy consumption was successfully reduced by 11.2&nbsp;%. This was a 28.8&nbsp;% increase in efficiency. A considerable increase in efficiency of 13.9&nbsp;% was also achieved in air transport compared to 2005. A slight improvement in the efficiency of private motorised transport was recently achieved due to an increased transport performance, eventhough energy consumption remained constant.<br><br><br><br>Private motorised transport by car and two-wheel vehicles accounted for 83.7&nbsp;% of total passenger transport performance in 2015. In 2016 it was 83.6%. This mode of transport can be subdivided into different categories. In 2015 (more recent data were not yet available), transport for recreational purposes accounted for the largest share (35.4&nbsp;%), closely followed by work-related transport (commuting and business trips) with 34.5&nbsp;%. Transport for shopping purposes accounted for 17.5%. The various transport purposes have developed differently since 2005.

The indicator expresses expenditure on housing relative to disposable household income. In case a household is in receipt of housing allowance or comparable social benefits such as payments for accommodation and heating from basic security benefits, these are also included in the calculation of the indicator. These social benefits are not added to the income, but are deducted from the housing costs so that the burden of housing costs of households that rely on housing-related social benefits is reduced or approaches zero.<br><br><br><br>The purchase of an owner-occupied property is not included in the expenditure on housing. Other spending on measures to enhance the value of a property should not be taken into account either. However, it is not always possible to clearly differentiate between these and value-maintaining expenditures that are considered as housing expenditure. Therefore, some simplifying assumptions must be made. Moreover, the indicator also does not take into account any additional expenditure associated with the place of residence. For instance, expenditure on travelling from the place of residence to the workplace is not taken into account, although it is possible that the threshold of 40&nbsp;% is not reached only due to the fact that the place of residence is far away from work.<br><br><br><br>By defining the threshold value as “40&nbsp;% of disposable household income”, the indicator provides no information about average housing costs. If clusters emerge close to this threshold, they can cause major changes in the indicator over time even if there is only a small change in the ratio of income and housing expenditure. <br><br><br><br>The indicator increased from 14.5&nbsp;% in 2010 to a relatively constant 16&nbsp;% during the period from 2011 until 2016. In 2017, it decreased to the initial value of 14.5&nbsp;%. However, due to statistical uncertainties this cannot be considered a statistically significant change, but constitutes more of a continuation at a similar level. Based on the current trend, it is therefore not (yet) possible to determine whether there is any movement in the direction of the set target.<br><br><br><br>With regard to the actual housing situation and disposable income, the indicator provides only a limited amount of information. After all, the calculation method also declares high-income households with a high housing expenditure as being overburdened. However, the data do indicate that considerably more households with a low income are above the 40&nbsp;% threshold. Separate analysis of the population at risk of poverty, i.e. of those people who have less than 60&nbsp;% of the median equivalised income of the population, also shows that the share of people overburdened by housing costs is closely related to income. Among those at risk of poverty, the proportion of people overburdened by housing costs rose from 42.2&nbsp;% (2010) to 54.4&nbsp;% (2014). In the following three years, this share declined slightly and stood at 48.5&nbsp;% in 2017. The proportion of people not considered to be at risk of poverty who were overburdened by housing costs was considerably lower and also relatively constant over time (starting value in 2010: 9.4&nbsp;%, peak in 2011: 10.5&nbsp;%, lowest value in 2017: 7.9&nbsp;%).", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_1"=>"https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/BevoelkerungSoziales/SozialesLebensbedingungen/SozialesLebensbedingungen.html", "source_url_text_1"=>"", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"11.3 Housing cost overload", "history_target_1"=>"Reduce the proportion of people who overburdened to 13&nbsp;% by 2030", "history_year_a_1"=>"2019", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_b_1"=>"2018", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_c_1"=>"2017", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_d_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_e_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Blitz", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}], "data_footnote"=>"2018 provisional data", "computation_units"=>"Percent", "copyright"=>"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021", "graph_title"=>"Proportion of people in households that spend more than 40&nbsp;% of their disposable income on housing", "graph_type"=>"line", "graph_min_value"=>"", "graph_max_value"=>"", "span_gaps"=>true, "show_line"=>true, "stackedBar"=>"", "national_geographical_coverage"=>"Germany", "page_content"=>"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>", "national_metadata_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_metadata_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/02c3bed61396013399007d015a93d8e3fffb58c0", "national_data_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_data_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4", "postulate"=>"Affordable housing for all"}"  class="myDivClass" style="background-color:white">

The indicator is designed to monitor whether environmentally friendly product variants are replacing conventional product variants in the market.

As the indicator covers only products that are newly introduced on the market in relation to the overall market, rebound effects are not considered.

It is therefore hardly possible to address it appropriately using one or a few indicators. The two indicators shown here focus exclusively on selected ecological aspects of sustainability, although they cannot reflect these environmental aspects exhaustively. Social and economic aspects of sustainability are not in the focus of the two indicators.<br><br><br><br><i>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per mileage of motor vehicles of the public sector</i><br><br><br><br>The data for motor vehicles of the public sector are provided by the environmental economic accounts of the Federal Statistical Office, also using the TREMOD (Transport Emission Model) database of the ifeu (German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research). The public sector comprises the federal level, the Länder level, the level of municipalities and associations of municipalities, the police, the Federal Border Guard, fire protection and fire brigades.<br><br><br><br>From 2015 to 2016, the average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kilometre driven by motor vehicles of the public sector decreased by around 2&nbsp;% from roughly 184 to 180.6 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometre. This has resulted in a separation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and mileage. The ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to mileage declined, although mileage continued to increase. In 2014, both mileage and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased. In 2015, however, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decreased for the first time, although mileage continued to grow. One reason for this could be the increasing procurement of more efficient motor vehicles and of electric and hybrid cars with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The propor-tion of electric and hybrid cars of the total stock of motor vehicles of the public sector increased from 0.6&nbsp;% (1,946 units) in 2015 to 0.9&nbsp;% (2,827 units) in 2016.<br><br><br><br>As far as the motor vehicles of the direct federal administration are concerned, the average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2017 were 179.9 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometre driven. The direct federal administration comprises the federal government’s own central and subordinate authorities, which are legally dependent. The data for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per mileage of motor vehicles of the direct federal administration are provided by the German Environment Agency. As in the case of motor vehicles of the public sector, all passenger cars of the direct federal administration up to a weight of 3.5 tonnes are taken into account; however, light commercial vehicles of this class are not considered. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2017, the proportion of newly acquired motor vehicles of the direct federal administration whose emission value was less than 50 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometre increased from 2.6&nbsp;% to 4.1&nbsp;% of the total volume of newly procured motor vehicles. This increase could result in lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and thus raise the efficiency of the vehicle fleet.<br><br><br><br>This indicator covers only those CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that occur during the operation of the vehicles. If, however, we consider the holistic life cycle costs approach, greenhouse gas emissions also occur in the production and disposal processes, which would have to be taken into account for a conclusive indicator. In addition, the sustainability of electric mobility depends for instance on the extent to which the electricity used is generated from conventional or renewable sources, on material expenditure, the materials used and recyclability.<br><br><br><br><i>Recycled paper bearing the Blue Angel label as a proportion of the total paper consumption of the direct federal administration</i><br><br><br><br>The data to calculate the volume of paper with the Blue Angel label as a proportion of the total paper consumption of the direct federal administration are obtained by the Sustainability Programme monitoring, which is carried out by the Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement at the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The Blue Angel is an eco-label for products and services with a reduced environmental impact. With regard to paper, this label indicates that 100&nbsp;% of the paper fibres are made from waste paper and no harmful chemicals or optical brighteners are used in the production process.<br><br><br><br>The proportion of paper bearing the Blue Angel label increased by roughly 48% between 2015 and 2017. While it accounted for 45&nbsp;% of the total paper consumption of the federal administration in 2015, it reached 67&nbsp;% in 2017. The indicator is thus in line with the objective of the Sustainability Programme to raise the proportion of Blue Angel paper used.<br><br><br><br>However, total paper consumption is subject to annual fluctuations. After a strong rise in total paper consumption to approximately 1,281 million sheets of paper in 2016, there was a slight decline in 2017 (roughly 1,250 million sheets). However, this value was still above the 2015 value (about 1,150 million sheets). This means that not only the consumption of paper with the Blue Angel label, but also total paper consumption (+8.7&nbsp;%) increased in the period from 2015 to 2017. The volume of Blue Angel paper as a proportion of the total paper consumption does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the efficient consumption of paper in general.", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"http://www.nachhaltige-beschaffung.info/DE/Home/home_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/knb.png\" alt=\" Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_active_2"=>true, "source_organisation_2"=>"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU)", "source_organisation_2_short"=>"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research", "source_organisation_logo_2"=>"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\" German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_active_3"=>true, "source_organisation_3"=>"German Environment Agency", "source_organisation_3_short"=>"German Environment Agency (UBA)", "source_organisation_logo_3"=>"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/uba.png\" alt=\" German Environment Agency (UBA)\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_active_4"=>true, "source_organisation_4"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_4_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_4"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"12.3.a Responsible procurement", "history_target_1"=>"95&nbsp;% by 2020", "history_active_2"=>true, "history_indicator_2"=>"12.3.b Responsible procurement", "history_target_2"=>"Reduce significantly", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Recycled paper bearing the blue angel label as a proportion of the total paper consumption of the federal administration"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per mileage of motor vehicles of the public sector"}], "data_footnote"=>"2018: Methodological break - data is not fully comparable", "computation_units"=>"2015=100", "copyright"=>"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021", "graph_title"=>"Responsible public procurement", "graph_type"=>"line", "graph_min_value"=>80.0, "graph_max_value"=>"", "span_gaps"=>true, "show_line"=>true, "stackedBar"=>"", "national_geographical_coverage"=>"Germany", "page_content"=>"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n    </h3>\n  </div>", "national_metadata_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_metadata_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/02c3bed61396013399007d015a93d8e3fffb58c0", "national_data_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_data_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4", "postulate"=>"Giving shape to the public sector’s exemplary role in sustainable procurement"}"  class="myDivClass" style="background-color:white">

The data source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which in this context also reports on climate financing by other federal ministries. In general, the information on bilateral climate finance is based on the relevant commitments, while the actual payments are taken as a basis for multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds. The indicator also includes the proportionately attributed climate finance derived from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks. If climate finance mainly benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development assistance (see indicator [17.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/17-1-a/)).<br><br><br><br>In 2017, Germany committed or provided 3.6 billion euros from budget funds for international climate finance to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change. Compared to the previous year, during which climate finance amounted to 3.4 billion euros, this represents an increase of [8.6](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-6-a/)&nbsp;%. A proportion of 43&nbsp;% of climate financing in 2017 was spent on emission reduction and 25&nbsp;% on adaptation to climate change. The remaining 32&nbsp;% were used to finance cross-sectoral projects. As in previous years, more funds were spent on mitigation than on adaptation projects in 2017.<br><br><br><br>Multilateral channels provided 13&nbsp;% (481 million euros) of climate finance in 2017. Of this amount, 187 million euros represent the climate finance allocated proporotionately to Germany, which results from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks.<br><br><br><br>The purely monetary analysis of climate finance does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of the financed projects. Based on its resources for technical and financial cooperation, the BMZ assesses how many tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will be saved in the future through mitigation projects. The impact assessments of financial cooperation are based on ex-ante estimates of the financing commitments of a year, while those of technical cooperation are calculated on an ex-post basis.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, direct savings of 8.7 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were achieved usingfinancial cooperation funds. Through technical cooperation funds, emissions of 9.1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were directly avoided between 2015 and 2017.<br><br><br><br>In addition to public climate financing from budget funds, the KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau) and the DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans via market funds. These represent the “mobilised public climate finance” which is not included in the indicator. In 2017, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to 3.1 billion euros compared to 5.2 billion euros in the previous year.

This also includes smaller rivers that flow into a larger river, rather than directly into the North Sea or the Baltic Sea. The measuring points are selected in such a way as to ensure that the data of the last measuring point before the confluence of the two rivers are taken into account. The Rhine, which does not flow into the sea in Germany, is also taken into account. Here the values are measured at the point where the Rhine leaves Germany (measuring point at Kleve, district Bimmen). The nitrogen concentrations of the individual rivers are averaged on a discharge-weighted basis, so that large rivers with large volumes of water discharge have a greater influence on the average than small rivers. Another substance that is discharged via rivers into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and causes eutrophication is phosphorus.

Therefore, the number of fish stocks that are sustainably managed based on the MSY approach should always be viewed in relation to overall fish stocks. Although an expansion of the investigation to include as many stocks as possible is desirable, the high cost of these investigations means that the prospect of recording all stocks, even those that are economically less relevant and less fished, is unrealistic.<br><br><br><br>Based on current estimates, a total of 58 fish stocks in the North Sea and 20 stocks in the Baltic Sea are used for economic purposes. The number of stocks examined using the MSY approach is currently 8 in the Baltic Sea and 22 in the North Sea. This means that only a third of all managed stocks are fully analysed with respect to sustainable management. All other stocks for which the data available are not sufficient for analysis according to the MSY method are not included in this indicator.<br><br><br><br>A stock is considered to be “sustainably managed” if the actual amount of fish caught per year and the fish stock do not exceed the scientifically recommended amount based on the MSY approach, or if they comply with the requirements of a long-term management plan assessed as sustainable according to the MSY approach. In this context, a “fish stock“ is defined as an independently reproducing population of a specific species of fish. A specific species can therefore have multiple stocks and, depending on the stock, can also have different guideline values regarding the amount of fish caught. As a rule, each stock is assigned a guideline value according to its previous development.<br><br><br><br>The guideline values for the managed stocks are calculated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).<br><br><br><br>The annual calculation of the amounts of fish caught sustainably according to the MSY approach is based on stochastic predictions, which use calculations of historical stock trends. Information about fish quantities landed is based on reported catches. Samples taken from this provide insights into the demographic parameters of the population, such as age and size. Other important sources of information on the state of fish stocks are scientific surveys conducted on research vessels that are independent of the fishing industry.<br><br><br><br>In 2016, the sustainably managed stocks of fish accounted for 56.7&nbsp;% of the total stocks examined in accordance with the MSY approach in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.

It is difficult to assess the indicator because it is influenced in addition to the development of the stocks, also by the selection of stocks to be considered. Thus, the basis of assessment can vary from year to year, which makes it difficult to compare the results of individual years.

The basis for determining this data set is, among other things, the soil overview map of Germany, the map of the mean annual infiltration rate from the soil, the land use distribution map and climate data for Germany.

These are criminal offences reported to the police and fully processed by them, provided that they do not involve offences against state security, traffic offences (with the exception of violations of Articles 315, 315b of the German Penal Code (StGB) and Article 22a of the Road Traffic Act (StVG)) or violations of the criminal laws of the Länder (except for the relevant regulations in the privacy laws of the Länder). Not included are criminal offences committed outside the Federal Republic of Germany as well as offences that are not within the area of responsibility of the police (e.g. financial and tax offences) or are reported directly to the public prosecutor and processed exclusively by him/her (e.g. offences relating to testimony).<br><br><br><br>The Police Crime Statistics publications are compiled annually based on the data available from the criminal police offices of the Länder and the Federal Criminal Police Office. To calculate the criminal offences per 100,000 inhabitants, the (back-calculated) population figures based on the 2011 census are used for the entire time series. This enables comparisons over time as of 1993, although these data can differ from the data of the Police Crime Statistics published for the time prior to 2013. Changes in the Police Crime Statistics do not, however, always reflect actual changes, as the statistics cover only criminal offences that officially come to the attention of the police. Since there are no statistical data on crimes that remain unknown to the police, such crimes cannot be shown in the Police Crime Statistics. If, for example, the reporting behaviour of the population changes, or the intensity with which the police pursue particular crimes, then the ratio between reported and unreported crime can change without there having been any change to the amount of actual crime committed.<br><br><br><br>The number of offences was 6,982 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 so that the target of less than 7,000 offences in 2030 has already been reached. Between 1993 and 2017, the indicator fell by 16.4&nbsp;%. However, this was not a continuous development. For example, it increased between 2000 and 2004, followed by a slight decrease until 2010. The large number of people who arrived in Germany as refugees and persons seeking asylum since 2015 is also reflected in the PKS. In 2016, violations of the legislation concerning foreigners (unauthorised entry, for example) increased by 211.8&nbsp;% compared to 2014. However, in 2017 these numbers decreased sharply and accounted for 3.1&nbsp;% of all criminal offences. Even if violations of the legislation concerning foreigners are excluded, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police in 2017 is lower than in previous years.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was 5.8 million. Domestic burglaries accounted for 2.0&nbsp;%, fraud for 15.8&nbsp;%, and dangerous and serious bodily injury for 2.4&nbsp;%. While the number of domestic burglaries decreased by 48.7&nbsp;% between 1993 and 2017, the cases of fraud increased by 72.3&nbsp;% and the cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury by 56.1&nbsp;%. When only the developments of the last five years are considered, there are deviations from the trend described above. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of domestic burglaries fell by 19.1&nbsp;% and cases of fraud by 5.0&nbsp;%, while cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury increased slightly by 0.7&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>The clear-up rate for all offences registered by the police in 2017 was 57.1&nbsp;%, and thus roughly at the previous year’s level. Considerable differences were apparent here depending on the type of criminal offence. The clear-up rate for domestic burglary, for example, was only about 17.8&nbsp;%. By contrast, 73.7&nbsp;% of fraud offences and 82.8&nbsp;% of the cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury were cleared up.

Thus, the indicator also takes into account those projects that are financed only in part by the government. The number of projects undertaken, however, says nothing about their scope or success. In addition, it is important to have well-defined and communicated criteria to clearly match a project with the objective of the indicator. The annual disarmament reports list projects aimed at combating small arms and their financing. Their number differs from the figures reported for the indicator.

ODA mainly includes expenditure for financial and technical cooperation with developing and emerging countries, humanitarian aid as well as contributions for development assistance to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union (EU), the World Bank or regional development banks. Furthermore, expenditure for specific peace missions, debt cancellation as well as costs of specific development assistance provided in the donor country, such as the tuition costs of university students from developing and emerging countries or expenditure for development-related research, can also be counted as ODA. In 2015, the calculation basis of the German ODA was adjusted to take greater account of the costs of housing, care and education of refugees within the donor country.<br><br><br><br>An expert group of the DAC has submitted proposals for harmonising and improving the comparability of the methods used to determine ODA eligible expenditure for refugees within the country. These proposals can be implemented by Member States as of reference year 2017 and have to be implemented as of reference year 2019 at the latest. The OECD, or the DAC, also define the list of ODA eligible developing and emerging countries. This includes the least developed countries (LDCs) on the one hand and other countries with low and medium GNI per capita on the other. Members of the G7 and Russia, the EU as well as EU accession candidates with a fixed accession date are excluded. The list is updated every three years. Changes in the indicator can also result from the fact that individual or several countries are added to or removed from the list.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, official development expenditure as a percentage of German GNI was 0.66&nbsp;% according to provisional figures. Net ODA flows in 2017 were around 21.9 billion euros (provisional value), which was a decrease of 2.1&nbsp;% year on year (22.4 billion euros). It should be noted that Germany saw a large influx of immigrants from conflict regions in 2015 and 2016. Benefits for the provision of basic services in Germany to asylum seekers from developing countries can be reported as ODA. This is one of the main reasons for the sharp increase of the figures recorded for 2015 and 2016 compared to 2014. In 2017, a slight reduction can be observed with decreasing immigration. Excluding the costs of refugees, the ODA quota remained almost constant from 2016 to 2017.<br><br><br><br>In an international comparison, Germany was the second largest donor of ODA funds in absolute terms in 2017 (provisional results) after the USA and ahead of the UK. With reference to GNI, the rate of 0.66&nbsp;% achieved by Germany in 2017 is above the average value of the EU members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (0.59&nbsp;%). In relative terms, Germany ranks 6th out of the 29 DAC member countries. The international goal of 0.7&nbsp;% was achieved in 2017 by Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and the UK.<br><br><br><br>In addition to official development assistance, private organisations such as churches, foundations and associations also make contributions. This private development assistance, which does not qualify as ODA, amounted to 1.3 billion euros in 2017, equating to a share of 0.04&nbsp;% of gross national income.

Die Daten auf der DNS-Online Plattform werden regelmäßig aktualisiert, sodass online aktuellere Daten verfügbar sein können als im Indikatorenbericht 2021 veröffentlicht.", "indicator_name"=>"Imports from least developed countries", "section"=>"Opening markets", "target_name"=>"Handelschancen der Entwicklungsländer verbessern", "target_id"=>"17.3.1", "previous"=>"17-2-a", "next"=>"1-1-ab", "content_and_progress"=>"<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021</i><br><br>Information about imports to Germany is compiled from the foreign trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office. In this case, the type of the imported goods is also recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, their value and weight. The service sector is excluded from foreign trade statistics.<br><br><br><br>The various countries are classified as LDCs based on the list of recipients of official development assistance kept by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The classifications valid in the respective year according to the OECD-DAC are used for this indicator. If the status of a country changes, this will impact the indicator even if the value of imports from this country remains unchanged. However, changes in the status of countries are scarcely relevant to the development of the indicator in the period shown.<br><br><br><br>Various factors can influence the value and development of the indicator. These can include technology transfers or changes in customs duties, but also the political stability of a country or the infrastructure. The additional provision of figures for processed products should address, at least to some extent, the question as to whether Germany mainly uses the LDCs as sources of basic materials for industrial products or whether the LDCs themselves are able to gain benefits from the value added by participating in the production process.<br><br><br><br>Due to reimports, duplicate counting in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be excluded. The fact that the imports from LDCs are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. This means that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from LDCs, but also on the value of all imports.<br><br><br><br>In addition to Germany’s overall imports from LDCs, the graph also shows the share of processed products. This includes all goods that are not classified as “raw materials” in the classification by product group of the food and industrial economy (EGW). Accordingly, unprocessed or barely processed goods extracted from nature, such as crude oil, ores, logs or plant-based textile fibres, are not included. In contrast, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br><br><br>Imports from LDCs as a proportion of all imports to Germany was 0.93&nbsp;% or 9.6 billion euros in 2017 (provisional results). This is an increase of more than 113&nbsp;% compared with 2002, when the share was just 0.44&nbsp;%. However, the positive development has been observed only since 2008. The share of imports of processed products from LDCs increased even more sharply between 2002 and 2017 (+146&nbsp;%). It has now reached 0.88% of total imports to Germany (2002: 0.36&nbsp;%), which equates to a value of around 9.1 billion euros. If the increase of the last five years continues, it can be assumed that the target will be reached.<br><br><br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that almost three quarters of imports from LDCs in 2017 came from Bangladesh (55.51&nbsp;%) and Cambodia (16.04&nbsp;%). Considering not only the LDCs but all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2017 was 21.86&nbsp;%, and the share of processed products was 20.09&nbsp;% (from 13.67&nbsp;% and 12.17&nbsp;% in 2002, respectively). Consequently, the imports from LDCs both in terms of all goods as well as processed goods accounted for a rather small share of imports from developing and emerging countries. As is shown above, their share of total imports has however increased more strongly over time. China plays the most important role among all developing and emerging countries. Imports from China alone as a proportion of all German imports was 9.74&nbsp;%, and 9.7&nbsp;% for processed goods. This makes China the leading country in terms of imports to Germany.", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_1"=>"https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=51000-0007&bypass=true&language=de", "source_url_text_1"=>"", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"17.3 Imports from the least developed countries (LCDs)", "history_target_1"=>"Increase the proportion by 100&nbsp;% by 2030 (base year: 2014)", "history_year_a_1"=>"2019", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_b_1"=>"2018", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_c_1"=>"2017", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_d_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_e_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_f_1"=>"2014", "history_status_year_f_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_g_1"=>"2013", "history_status_year_g_1"=>"Sonne", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}, {"field"=>"Time series", "value"=>"Imports from LDCs"}], "data_footnote"=>"2019 provisional data", "computation_units"=>"", "copyright"=>"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021", "graph_title"=>"Imports from the least developed countries (LCDs)", "graph_type"=>"line", "graph_min_value"=>"", "graph_max_value"=>"", "span_gaps"=>true, "show_line"=>true, "stackedBar"=>"", "national_geographical_coverage"=>"Germany", "page_content"=>"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>", "national_metadata_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_metadata_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/02c3bed61396013399007d015a93d8e3fffb58c0", "national_data_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_data_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4", "postulate"=>"Improving trade opportunities for developing countries"}"  class="myDivClass" style="background-color:white">
