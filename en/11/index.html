Settlement and transport includes the following types of land use: building and adjacent open area, commercial or industrial area (excluding exploitation area), transport area, recreation area and cemeteries. The indicator does not focus on sealed land, instead it also covers non-built-up and unsealed land such as gardens, yard areas and landscape surrounding transport infrastructure as well as open spaces such as parks and other green spaces, allotment gardens, garden land within towns, sports and leisure facilities, camp sites as well as cemeteries. According to calculations of the environmental-economic accounts of the Länder, the average sealed proportion of the settlement and transport area in the Länder is estimated at just over 45&nbsp;% (2013).<br><br><br><br>The data source for the indicator is the area survey by type of actual use in the official land registers of the Länder. Changes in the methodology of the official land registers in previous years have increasingly resulted in the reclassification of land not caused by real changes of use. In order to partially offset the resulting distortion, a moving average is formed, in each case, from the four preceding years to enable the evaluation of the relevant development.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. For this reason, the development of the indicator in 2016 is shown only as a four-year moving average.<br><br><br><br>Between 1992 and 2015, 8,761 km² of land were converted for use as settlement and transport area. As a result, the settlement and transport area expanded by 21.7&nbsp;% compared to 1992; the settlement area by 29.7&nbsp;% and transport area by [10.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-1-a/)&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>In recent years, this increase in the amount of settlement and transport area has noticeably slowed down. In 2015, the four-year moving average for land used for the first time for settlement and transport purposes was 66 hectares per day, compared to 120 hectares per day at the start of the time series. If the average trend of the previous five years is maintained, the originally specified goal of 30 hectares per day, which is supposed to be reached by 2020, will be achieved in 2030. In 2016, the four-year moving average decreased further to a value of 62 hectares for newly occupied settlement and transport areas. <br><br><br><br>From 2005 to 2009, the development of the settlement area was temporarily dominated by high growth rates in the “recreation area, cemeteries” type of land use.

A distinction must be made between open space areas, and open areas as well as housing open areas, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks, green spaces or wildlife preserves, which – although they are non-built-up areas – are considered part of the housing and transport area. Therefore, if buildings are erected in gardens, parks or green spaces, this development will not be reflected in this indicator. However, such a development would increase the population density. In this respect, the indicator “Loss of open space area” corresponds to indicators [11.1.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-a/) “Expansion of housing and transport area “ and [11.1.c](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-c/) “Density of settlements”.<br><br><br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office.

In addition to residential building areas, the settlement area includes areas with special functional character (e.g. hospitals and schools), industrial and commercial areas and mixed-use areas as well as open areas (parks, green spaces, garden land). Consequently, changes not only in population numbers, but also in the residential building area, such as an internal densification of the transport or commercial area, lead to a change in the density of settlements.<br><br><br><br>The density of settlements differs substantially between rural and non-rural regions: one square kilometre of settlement and transport area accommodates around 3,330 people on average in non-rural district types, compared with around 1,216 people in rural district types (as in 2016). In this context, the residential building area in cities is frequently a much more densely built-up area as well as has many more multiple-floor buildings than rural regions, where more scattered development incorporating larger, unsealed areas such as domestic gardens is prevalent.<br><br><br><br>From 2000 until the end of 2010, there was a steady decline in the density of settlements in both rural and non-rural regions. In this context, the non-rural regions experienced a slightly lower absolute decrease than the rural regions.

In non-rural regions, the density of settlements rose steadily from 3,251 inhabitants per square kilometre (2012) to 3,330 (2016). In rural regions, the decrease in the density of settlements continued at a moderate pace until 2014 (1,210 inhabitants/km²). In 2015, however, there was an increase (1,218 inhabitants/km²), presumably due to the population growth resulting from the influx of refugees, which slowed in 2016 (1,216 inhabitants/km²).<br><br><br><br>Considering the development of the number of inhabitants and the settlement and transport area separately, considerable differences between rural and non-rural regions can be observed.

As a result, transport flows and the associated energy consumption that arises due to German exports and imports are not included.<br><br><br><br>In addition to energy consumption, energy efficiency, i.e. energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, is also presented.

This sharp increase can be attributed primarily to goods transport by road. Final energy consumption for road goods transport increased during this period by 12.2&nbsp;%, while consumption for rail and inland waterways transport was considerably reduced (– 8.5% and – 17.8% respectively).<br><br><br><br>During the same period, the goods transport performance increased by 12.9&nbsp;%.

This heavy loss affected the transport sector in particular, which reacts directly to increases and decreases in the production of goods. The resulting lower utilisation of transport capacity explains the slight increase in average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, despite the fact that overall energy consumption fell sharply during the crisis years.<br><br><br><br>Besides the presumably short-term consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2009, a number of long-term factors also influenced the development of final energy consumption in goods transport during the review period between 2005 and 2016. For instance, the number of production steps per company has decreased, something that is normally associated with greater transport volumes because companies procure more intermediate goods from domestic and international suppliers. Furthermore, the average distance between the production location for the goods and their place of use increased, which also caused transport volumes to increase. These effects are countered by a shift in the demand structure towards less material-intensive goods (e. g. an increasing demand for services).

Means of public transport are defined as those transport services that can be used by anyone on payment of the relevant fees. Flexible forms of operation, such as on-call buses that operate on demand without fixed stopping points and timetables, are therefore not taken into account.<br><br><br><br>The data basis comprises schedule data of the Deutsche Bahn, transport associations along with numerous other timetables. With the help of the timetable data, the travel times to the nearest medium-sized or large city during peak morning traffic times were determined for approximately 250,000 stops. This time period is defined differently in the two reference years. Whereas connections with an arrival time between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. were taken into account in 2012, only those with arrival times between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon were included in 2016.<br><br><br><br>Since not all local transport schedules were fully integrated into the database used, the values for 2012 and 2016 are not fully comparable. The frequency of a transport service to the nearest medium-sized or large city is similarly disregarded as is the travel time to and from the stop. Furthermore, this indicator is based on the timetable data – which means that delays or even cancellations are not taken into account.<br><br><br><br>The classification of a location as a medium-sized or large city is determined according to the availability of goods, services and infrastructure at that location that are not available in the surrounding smaller places. These include, among other things, specialist medical practices, hospitals, cultural facilities as well as secondary schools and institutions of higher education.<br><br><br><br>In each medium-sized or large city, especially in major cities, only one destination point (city centre) was determined. The destination stops were selected within a radius of one kilometre around the destination point, and the fastest connection from the starting stop to the destination was searched for. With the help of small-area population data from the Federal Statistical Office, a population-weighted average value of the travel time for Germany was then determined.<br><br><br><br>The indicator is related to the United Nations indicator 11.2.1 “Access to public transport”. Germany reports, based on data from the German Mobility Panel, the proportion of the population living within ten minutes of a public stop. Based on these data, around 94&nbsp;% of the population had access to public transport in 2017.<br><br><br><br>The indicator values available for 2012 and 2016 show that the population-weighted average travel time to the nearest medium-sized or large city has declined from 23.5 to 22.4 minutes during this period. This corresponds to a reduction of 4.7&nbsp;%. It is not possible to determine the extent to which the previously described methodological changes or re-designation of medium-sized cities are also responsible for the decrease.

The indicator expresses expenditure on housing relative to disposable household income. In case a household is in receipt of housing allowance or comparable social benefits such as payments for accommodation and heating from basic security benefits, these are also included in the calculation of the indicator. These social benefits are not added to the income, but are deducted from the housing costs so that the burden of housing costs of households that rely on housing-related social benefits is reduced or approaches zero.<br><br><br><br>The purchase of an owner-occupied property is not included in the expenditure on housing. Other spending on measures to enhance the value of a property should not be taken into account either. However, it is not always possible to clearly differentiate between these and value-maintaining expenditures that are considered as housing expenditure. Therefore, some simplifying assumptions must be made. Moreover, the indicator also does not take into account any additional expenditure associated with the place of residence. For instance, expenditure on travelling from the place of residence to the workplace is not taken into account, although it is possible that the threshold of 40&nbsp;% is not reached only due to the fact that the place of residence is far away from work.<br><br><br><br>By defining the threshold value as “40&nbsp;% of disposable household income”, the indicator provides no information about average housing costs. If clusters emerge close to this threshold, they can cause major changes in the indicator over time even if there is only a small change in the ratio of income and housing expenditure. <br><br><br><br>The indicator increased from 14.5&nbsp;% in 2010 to a relatively constant 16&nbsp;% during the period from 2011 until 2016. In 2017, it decreased to the initial value of 14.5&nbsp;%. However, due to statistical uncertainties this cannot be considered a statistically significant change, but constitutes more of a continuation at a similar level. Based on the current trend, it is therefore not (yet) possible to determine whether there is any movement in the direction of the set target.<br><br><br><br>With regard to the actual housing situation and disposable income, the indicator provides only a limited amount of information. After all, the calculation method also declares high-income households with a high housing expenditure as being overburdened. However, the data do indicate that considerably more households with a low income are above the 40&nbsp;% threshold. Separate analysis of the population at risk of poverty, i.e. of those people who have less than 60&nbsp;% of the median equivalised income of the population, also shows that the share of people overburdened by housing costs is closely related to income. Among those at risk of poverty, the proportion of people overburdened by housing costs rose from 42.2&nbsp;% (2010) to 54.4&nbsp;% (2014). In the following three years, this share declined slightly and stood at 48.5&nbsp;% in 2017. The proportion of people not considered to be at risk of poverty who were overburdened by housing costs was considerably lower and also relatively constant over time (starting value in 2010: 9.4&nbsp;%, peak in 2011: 10.5&nbsp;%, lowest value in 2017: 7.9&nbsp;%).", "source_active_1"=>true, "source_organisation_1"=>"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)", "source_organisation_1_short"=>"Federal Statistical Office", "source_organisation_logo_1"=>"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>", "source_url_1"=>"https://www.destatis.de/Europa/DE/Thema/BevoelkerungSoziales/SozialesLebensbedingungen/SozialesLebensbedingungen.html", "source_url_text_1"=>"", "history_active_1"=>true, "history_indicator_1"=>"11.3 Housing cost overload", "history_target_1"=>"Reduce the proportion of people who overburdened to 13&nbsp;% by 2030", "history_year_a_1"=>"2019", "history_status_year_a_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_b_1"=>"2018", "history_status_year_b_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_c_1"=>"2017", "history_status_year_c_1"=>"Sonne", "history_year_d_1"=>"2016", "history_status_year_d_1"=>"Wolke", "history_year_e_1"=>"2015", "history_status_year_e_1"=>"Blitz", "data_show_map"=>"", "data_keywords"=>"", "data_start_values"=>[{"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Time series"}, {"field"=>"Display", "value"=>"Target"}], "data_footnote"=>"2018 provisional data", "computation_units"=>"Percent", "copyright"=>"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021", "graph_title"=>"Proportion of people in households that spend more than 40&nbsp;% of their disposable income on housing", "graph_type"=>"line", "graph_min_value"=>"", "graph_max_value"=>"", "stackedBar"=>"", "national_geographical_coverage"=>"Germany", "page_content"=>"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>", "national_metadata_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_metadata_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/45961d32dd5a85c0698dffe02deaa3afb11c2b13", "national_data_update_url_text"=>"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub", "national_data_update_url"=>"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4", "postulate"=>"Affordable housing for all"}], "size"=>1}
