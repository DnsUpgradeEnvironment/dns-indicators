Due to the growing demand for raw materials, worldwide raw material deposits are increasingly being developed in areas that are particularly sensitive to human influences. For this reason, the Federal Government set the goal of continuing to increase raw material input productivity already in 2016 in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II. From 2000 to 2010, raw material input productivity was already increasing by an annual average of around 1.6&nbsp;%. This positive trend should be continued up to 2030.", "data_state"=>"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

The calculation of this variable, referred to as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br><br><br>Due to the monetary and physical inclusion of imports, the indicator takes into account the value added and raw material use across the entire production chain both inside and outside of Germany. In this way, the economic interdependence with foreign countries is also taken into account comprehensively. The raw material use mapped in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also exports. It should therefore not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br><br><br>The indicator includes not only the raw materials that were considered to be non-renewable, that is, mineral raw materials and fossile fuels, but also plant-based products from farming and forestry activities. This means that double counting occurs to a limited degree. For example, both the mass of an agricultural product at harvest time as well as that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br><br><br>Based on preliminary results, the value of the indicator increased by 26&nbsp;% from 2000 to 2014. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator: the value of the final use (domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports) increased by 31&nbsp;% during the reference period. The removal of domestic raw materials fell moderately between 2000 and 2014; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, causing a slight increase of 4&nbsp;% in the indicator’s denominator.<br><br><br><br>Domestically extracted raw materials as well as imports are also being exported (again) to an increasing degree. Consequently, the indicator’s denominator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany, but reflects generally more intensive links between the German economy and the outside world.<br><br><br><br>The year 2009 should be considered an outlier due to the exceptional economic situation in the European financial market and economic crisis . The values for the years 2010 to 2014 continued the path of development that prevailed up to 2008.

It includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), machinery and equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools), weapons systems and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources). Also included are improvements on existing stocks of fixed assets that lead to a significant increase in the value of an asset and/or prolong its useful life.<br><br><br><br>Gross fixed capital formation is determined as part of national accounts, which are compiled in accordance with harmonised European rules and based on all available, relevant data sources.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP was 20.3&nbsp;% and was thus 4.5 percentage points below the initial value in 1991 for the entire federal territory as well as 2.7&nbsp;% percentage points lower than in 2000. The indicator has moved into the desired direction both in the short and medium term; however, it has been largely stagnating since 2002. The share would be almost unchanged (19.5&nbsp;%) on a price-adjusted basis compared with 2010. The investment ratio in Germany was an annual average of 19.9&nbsp;% between 2007 and 2016, which was below the investment ratio for the entire OECD region (20.9&nbsp;%). The difference has been considerably smaller since 2010 than in the period between 2003 and 2008 (– 2.9 percentage points).<br><br><br><br>Looking at the time series reveals a wavelike trend in the investment ratio that is marked by declines at the start of the millennium and, following a slight recovery, again in 2009 after the financial market and economic crisis of 2008/2009. Up to 2011, investment activity recovered, and gross fixed capital formation once again exceeded the level of the pre-crisis year. Between 2014 and 2017, gross fixed capital formation grew strongly by 13.3&nbsp;% in total and reached a level of 666 billion euros. Since the increase in nominal GDP in the same period was slightly lower (11.5&nbsp;%), the investment ratio increased slightly from 20.0 to 20.3&nbsp;% and reached the level of 2008 and 2011.<br><br><br><br>With regard to gross fixed capital formation in construction, the dwellings sector has recorded strong nominal growth (+48.8&nbsp;%) since 2010, while the growth of gross fixed capital formation in other buildings and structures (both in building construction and underground construction) in the same period was less pronounced (+23.5&nbsp;%) and even slightly declined in 2012 and 2015. Gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment at current prices increased most recently by 2.6&nbsp;% (2016) and 4.2&nbsp;% (2017) compared to the previous year and – despite the sharp decline in 2009 (– 22.0&nbsp;%) – surpassed the pre-crisis level of 2008.

In 2017, 74.9&nbsp;% of fixed capital formation was made in the service branches. In 1991, this figure was still 67.5&nbsp;%. The largest single investment area was that of real estate activities. In 2017 alone, this sector accounted for 31.2&nbsp;% of all new fixed assets.

The focus in this context is primarily on goods and services that are traded on markets as well as on public goods and services. GDP is determined quarterly and annually by the Federal Statistical Office in accordance with rules that are harmonised throughout Europe. Due to the early calculation dates, many of the necessary basic data are not available in time for the first release date. Instead, the first release is still largely based on indicators and estimates. Missing information is initially estimated or carried forward. The data basis is subsequently improved with additional statistics, which are successively incorporated into the calculations. Only after around four years are all basic statistics available, and the data are then classified as “final”.<br><br><br><br>GDP and other standard aggregates of the European System of National and Regional Accounts represent an important part of the material wealth, namely, income generated primarily in the market and its use. However, GDP is not suitable for use as a welfare indicator, because an assessment of material wealth is not sufficient to achieve a comprehensive calculation of well-being and quality of life. This requires additional indicators, for example, to cover unpaid work in households, which is not included in the calculation of GDP. Also, the distribution of income (and assets) among different population groups is not shown by GDP.<br><br><br><br>The GDP is also a pure flow parameter that generally refers to the period of a quarter or a year.

Key economic variables such as stocks and qualities of human capital (such as education, health), of social capital (such as security, integration) and of natural capital (such as resources, ecosystems) are excluded. Statements as to whether GDP and its growth have led to capital preservation in a broad sense are therefore not possible.
