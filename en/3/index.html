As part of the causes of death statistics, all official cause of death certificates are recorded and evaluated. The population statistics specify the current population based on the results of the most recent census. The data refer to the “old” standardised European population of 1976. Those under 1 year of age and consequently the infant mortality rate are excluded from the assessment. The indicator is also part of the Federal Health Monitoring information system.<br><br><br><br>Premature mortality steadily decreased between 1991 and 2015, both for women (– 36%) and for men (– 42%). As a result of this decrease, the gender difference in premature mortality declined, too. In 2015, for example, 153 women and 288 men per 100,000 inhabitants died before they reached the age of 70. If this trend continues unchanged as seen in recent years, the gender-specific targets for 2030 will not be achieved.<br><br><br><br>In accordance with the steady decrease in premature mortality, the trend for life expectancy in Germany continued developing in a positive direction. 70-year-old women today can expect, statistically, to live another 16.9 years and 70-year-old men another 14.2 years.<br><br><br><br>Between 2014 and 2016, the average life expectancy was 83.2 years for new-born girls and 78.3 years for boys, which was 0.5 years higher for girls and 0.6 years for boys than the average for the years 2009 to 2011. Differences in life expectancy between the western Länder and the eastern Länder (each excluding Berlin) are to be seen only among new-born boys. In this case, the difference is 1.3 years.<br><br><br><br>The largest share of all causes of premature mortality in 2015 was malignant neoplasms (37.8&nbsp;%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (21.4&nbsp;%). Deaths due to external causes (such as accidents, poisoning, suicide) accounted for as much as 8.8&nbsp;%. Diseases of the digestive and respiratory tracts contributed 6.9&nbsp;% and 5.5&nbsp;%, respectively, to the causes of death.

It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual’s height in metres. This calculation does not take age-specific and gender-specific differences into account. Nor does it indicate the individual body mass composition. However, obesity and excess weight among children and adolescents are defined by taking account also of age and gender. In order to determine if people suffer from obesity or excess weight, the individual BMI value is compared with a defined comparison group (reference population). The percentile reference values according to Kromeyer-Hauschild as recommended by the “Arbeitsgemeinschaft Adipositas im Kinder- und Jugendalter” (AGA) are used as a comparative benchmark. According to these values, children and adolescents are considered to be overweight if their BMI value is above the 90th age- and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> P90). This means that they fall within the range of those 10&nbsp;% of the reference group with the highest BMI values. A BMI value above the 97th percentile of the reference population (that is, as high as the 3&nbsp;% of adolescents with the highest BMI values) is classified as obesity (> P97). These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985 and 1998 in various regions of Germany using different methods.<br><br><br><br>The data for the indicator are gathered by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS – referred to as the KiGGS baseline study) for the period 2003 to 2006 delivered the first nationwide representative results. In 2015, new results for the reporting years 2009 to 2012 were published (KiGGS Wave 1). These results were based on information provided by respondents via telephone rather than on measured data as in the baseline survey. New measurement data are available for the period 2014 to 2017 from the second follow-up survey of the KiGGS study (KiGGS Wave 2). In order to allow the data to be compared in a suitable way, the results were age standardised to the reference date 31 December 2015 of the population update.<br><br><br><br>For the time period 2014 to 2017, 8.0&nbsp;% of the adolescents were classified as obese. The proportion of girls was 7.2&nbsp;% and that of boys 8.7&nbsp;%. In the period 2003–2006, the proportion of adolescents suffering from obesity was [8.3](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-3-a/)&nbsp;%, that is, 8.2&nbsp;% of the girls and [8.4](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-4-a/)&nbsp;% of the boys. Overall, the obesity rate among adolescents was slightly down. While the obesity rate amongst girls decreased by 1.0 percentage point, the rate increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points amongst boys.<br><br><br><br>The proportion of adolescents suffering from excess weight including obesity (> P90) did not change much compared with the period 2003 – 2006 (increase by 0.6 percentage points to 18.7&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>Important factors in the development of overweight are dietary and exercise behaviour, which differ – when looking at the results – in terms of socioeconomic status (SES). The results from KiGGS Wave 2 confirm that 3 to 17-year-old children and adolescents with a low socioeconomic status eat unhealthy more often than their peers from socially better-off families and exercise less frequently. The risk of overweight and obesity is about 3 to 4 times higher for children and adolescents with low SES than in the upper status group (about 20&nbsp;% of the study population).<br><br><br><br>An opposite phenomenon to overweight is underweight. A BMI value below the 10th percentile of the reference population indicates underweight.

People with a BMI of 25 and above are classified as “overweight” according to the WHO and those with a BMI of 30 as “obese”. The BMI is a benchmark that does not take account of the physique, age- and gender-specific differences as well as the individual body mass composition. <br><br><br><br>The data used for the indicator are based on the microcensus of the Federal Statistical Office. The sample survey is conducted among 1&nbsp;% of the total population. The responses to the health questions, which are generally asked every four years, are voluntary. Consequently, the indicator is based on the proportion of the population with a BMI of 30 and higher that also answered the microcensus questions concerning body weight and body size. The corresponding data were standardised relative to the European population of 1990 to allow data from different years and regions to be compared without distortions due to different age structures. Since the questions on health in the microcensus are not asked annually, the interim years in the chart were interpolated.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, 14.6&nbsp;% of the population in Germany over the age of 18 were obese. Here, the share of obese men (16.3&nbsp;%) was higher than the share of obese women (12.9&nbsp;%). Before, in 1999, the share of obese persons was only 10.7&nbsp;% of the population. At that time, the proportion of women ([10.2](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-2-a/)&nbsp;%) affected by obesity was also slightly lower than that of men (11.1&nbsp;%). Thus, the obesity rate among adults has increased and is developing contrary to the goal envisioned by the German Sustainable Development Strategy. Another 33.9&nbsp;% of the population aged 18 and over had a BMI of 25 to under 30 in 2017. In total, 48.5&nbsp;% were considered to be overweight (BMI 25 and over). The proportion of women (38.7&nbsp;%) was significantly smaller than that of men (57.7&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>The proportion of adults suffering from obesity increases with age, and the trend reverses only among people at a very advanced age. In 2017, 3.4&nbsp;% of 18 and 19-year-old women were obese. At the age of 30 to under 35, [10.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-1-a/)&nbsp;% of the women were obese. The highest proportion of obese women (21.7&nbsp;%) was found in the age group between 60 and under 65 years of age. The rate of obesity among men was higher among those under 75 than among women of the same age and reached the highest proportions in the age groups 60 to under 65 (24.5&nbsp;%) and 65 to under 70 (25.3&nbsp;%). It is interesting to note that the proportion of obese women is higher than the proportion of obese men at older ages – above about 75 years of age. At this age, however, the proportion of men in the population is also considerably lower. As of 31 December 2017, the proportion of men aged 75 and over in the population at this age was only 40&nbsp;%, while the gender distribution between 50 and 60 years was balanced. This imbalance in old age can be attributed to the higher life expectancy of women or to the fact that men die earlier than women.<br><br><br><br>Being underweight, i. e. having a BMI lower than 18.5, is the opposite phenomenon to that of obesity. In 2017, the share of women who were underweight (4.0&nbsp;%) was considerably greater than the share found in men (1.0&nbsp;%).

However, the computation of this indicator takes account only of those measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particulate matter emissions e.g. from transport, as these map only elevated peak values (“hot spots”) rather than general pollution levels. This recorded data which is called background pollution is combined with geographical information to determine the number of persons who are exposed to an average annual particulate matter pollution of more than 20 μg per m³ of air at their place of residence. Since the modelled calculation is based only on measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particular matter emissions from local sources, it may well be assumed that the indicator underestimates the level of pollution.<br><br><br><br>Rather than indicating nationwide compliance with the guideline value, the indicator merely shows that the value is not exceeded at the population’s places of residence. Neither does it give any indication of the exposure level of the population in total nor its variation in the course of the year. In addition, this indicator makes no provision for the separate analysis of pollution caused by finer particulate matter particles (PM<sub>2,5</sub> and PM<sub>0,1</sub>).<br><br><br><br>Particulate matter is mainly generated during the combustion processes of fossil fuels such as heating, in industrial plants or road traffic. Besides these primary sources, particulate matter can also be a secondary product of the chemical reaction of air pollutants, e.g. from agriculture.<br><br><br><br>The last few years have seen a significant reduction in particulate matter pollution caused by PM<sub>10</sub>. While in 2007 the average pollution exposure of the population was still 20.7 μg per m³ of air, in 2015 it was just 16.5 μg per m³. During the same period, the number of people exposed to an annual average of more than 20 μg PM<sub>10</sub> per m³ of air at their place of residence has also fallen considerably – from around 50 million people in 2007 to only around 4 million people in 2015.
