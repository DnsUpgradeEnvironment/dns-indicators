This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.

Home births will on many occasions have a skilled health professional present (a midwife) as some women choose to have a home birth so a midwife attends. There will be some home births which occur without a midwife but an ambulance is sent and arrives just before or soon after the birth - these are births which happen too quick for the mother to get to hospital.
  
Data availability within the UK is limited to England and Wales for this indicator.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
