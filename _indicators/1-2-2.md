"Percentage of the population living in households persistently at risk of poverty" data from EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is being used for international comparability. For the main UK data series on persistent low income households see the [Income Dynamics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/income-dynamics-experimental) experimental statistics.
