"Percentage of the population living in households at risk of poverty" data from EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is being used for international comparability. For the main UK data series on low income households see the [Households below average income (HBAI) statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2).

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
