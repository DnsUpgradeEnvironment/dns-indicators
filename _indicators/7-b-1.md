**Proxy indicator (Expert Led)**              

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has been developed in collaboration with the topic expert. We will work to develop UK data to meet the global indicator specifications.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk.
